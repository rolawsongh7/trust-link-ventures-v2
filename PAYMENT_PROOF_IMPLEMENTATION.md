# Customer Payment Proof Upload Implementation

## Overview
This implementation allows customers to upload payment receipts directly, reducing the admin's burden of manually checking bank accounts. The system provides a complete workflow from customer upload to admin verification.

## Process Flow

### 1. Customer Side (Payment Upload)
**Location:** `/customer/orders`

**Steps:**
1. Customer receives payment instructions email with bank/mobile money details
2. Customer makes payment via their chosen method
3. Customer clicks "Upload Payment Proof" button on order with `pending_payment` status
4. Customer uploads receipt (JPG, PNG, or PDF, max 10MB)
5. Customer enters payment reference/transaction ID
6. Customer confirms payment method used
7. System uploads file with automatic retry (up to 3 attempts)
8. Order updated with payment proof details
9. Admin receives instant notification

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Chunked upload with progress bar
- ✅ Automatic retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- ✅ File validation (type & size)
- ✅ Duplicate upload prevention
- ✅ Real-time progress feedback
- ✅ Success/error notifications

### 2. Admin Side (Payment Verification)
**Location:** `/admin/orders`

**Steps:**
1. Admin receives notification of uploaded payment proof
2. Admin opens Orders Management
3. Orders with uploaded proofs show "Verify Payment Proof" action
4. Admin clicks to open verification dialog
5. Admin reviews:
   - Payment method
   - Transaction reference
   - Upload timestamp
   - Receipt image/PDF (viewable directly)
6. Admin clicks "Verify & Approve Payment"
7. System automatically:
   - Updates order status to `payment_received`
   - Records who verified and when
   - Moves order to `processing` queue
   - Sends confirmation email to customer
   - Creates customer notification

**Key Features:**
- ✅ In-app receipt viewer (images & PDFs)
- ✅ Payment details summary
- ✅ Verification audit trail
- ✅ Automatic status progression
- ✅ Instant customer notification

## Database Changes

### New Columns Added to `orders` Table:
```sql
- payment_proof_uploaded_at (TIMESTAMP) - When customer uploaded proof
- payment_verified_by (UUID) - Admin who verified payment
- payment_verified_at (TIMESTAMP) - When verification occurred
```

### Existing Columns Used:
```sql
- payment_proof_url (TEXT) - URL to uploaded receipt
- payment_reference (TEXT) - Transaction reference
- payment_method (TEXT) - 'bank_transfer' or 'mobile_money'
